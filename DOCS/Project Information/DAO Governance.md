<p>As development progresses, a number of governance mechanics are planned. Our ultimate goal is to align the vision of the platform with players and the development team by providing ongoing engagement and incentives to our community whilst contributing to the platform future expansion.</p>
<p>We intend to use a DAO governance model, allowing players to make proposals and giving them a voice in decision making on the future of the game, new features and events.</p>
