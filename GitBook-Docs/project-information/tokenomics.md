# 📊 Tokenomics

#### The Tokenomics system will be designed to create a fair and sustainable ecosystem for our users. We are working on the creation of a token that will serve as the main utility unit on our platform, enabling users to access various services and applications. The token will also play a key role in our governance system, allowing token holders to participate in important decisions related to the future development and direction of the platform.

#### We believe that the creation of the Tokenomics system will bring numerous benefits to our platform and our users. By implementing a sustainable economic model, we aim to incentivize long-term participation and engagement from our users. This will help to create a strong community of supporters and contributors, driving the growth and development of Jax World.

#### At Jax World, we are committed to building a robust and sustainable ecosystem for our users. Our Tokenomics system is a key step in achieving this goal, and we look forward to working with our community to shape the future of our platform.

#### Detailed information about our Governance token and the Tokenomics strategy is coming soon.
