# 🎟 Tickets

In the Saloon, where we will offer a range of exhilarating games, including some with a gamified element, we are implementing various ways for users to enjoy them.&#x20;

You will have the option to play using our DAO Token, AVAX, or tickets.&#x20;

Tickets come in four different types: bronze, silver, gold, and premium.&#x20;

Acquiring tickets can be done through various methods.&#x20;

For instance, owners of the G Minions will receive a weekly allocation of tickets based on the rarity of the NFTs they hold.&#x20;

These received tickets can only be used within the same week they were received.&#x20;

If a user owns multiple G Minions, they will receive tickets for each NFT they own, with the type of tickets being determined by the rarity of the G Minions they possess.&#x20;

Additionally, premium tickets can only be obtained through private events, not by holding an NFT.

Each type of ticket holds a different value within the Saloon games, and we will share more detailed information about their specific usage soon. [Stay tuned](https://discord.com/invite/dPNE6fK4S4) for updates on how to make the most of your tickets and maximize your gaming experience!
